<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm Omowonuola Othniel Ireoluwa. A citizen of the republic of Nigeria born in Osun State, 
  a western part of the country. I was given birth to in a family of Five(I, My Parents and 
  two siblings-an older and a younger). I'm a 25 year Old who graduated from the University of Lagos 
  with a second class division in Actuarial Science that deals with making statistical analysis of

  Over the years, I've engaged myself in several activities in order for me to be able to
  afford some of my basic needs for survival. I currently work as a music director
  in my local church and as an Educator who teaches Accounting, Economics, Marketing and Commerce.
  Teaching these courses has developed my interest in business management and administration. <br/>
  It has also helped me make decisions of taking online courses on data analysis, data science,
  business analysis which has prompted me to go for a masters degree in any business related field.

  Business is a what everyone engages in consciously or unconsciously. It's more than what we think.
  It's beyond what we see. I believe going for this program will broaden my knowledge so I also can 
  enlighten both the young and old about how business has been and is beneficial to the public. Thank you
